Here‚Äôs how to install and run the Debate-ai project by Crinklyink from GitHub on your computer:

‚úÖ Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository
If it's your own repo (Crinklyink), you probably already have access. Otherwise:

Option A: Clone via Git
Open a terminal (or Command Prompt / PowerShell).

Run:

git clone https://github.com/Crinklyink/Debate-ai.git
cd Debate-ai
Option B: Download ZIP
Go to https://github.com/Crinklyink/Debate-ai.

Click ‚ÄúCode‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù.

Extract it and open the folder in VS Code or your editor.

‚úÖ Step 2: Set Up Python Environment
Open terminal in the folder (Shift + Right Click ‚Üí "Open Terminal Here" or inside VS Code).

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
Install necessary dependencies. If there's no requirements.txt, try manually:

pip install openai
pip install tkinter
You might also need python-dotenv, requests, or customtkinter if your code uses them. You can install those later if errors occur.

‚úÖ Step 3: Run the App
You mentioned a GUI. The main file is probably debate_gui.py or debate_gui_new.py.

Run it with:

python debate_gui.py
# or
python debate_gui_new.py
üîß Optional: Create a requirements.txt (if missing)
Once it works, save your dependencies:

pip freeze > requirements.txt
‚ùó Common Errors
Tkinter not installed: Run sudo apt install python3-tk (Linux) or ensure your Python includes Tkinter (Windows/macOS usually do).

Missing OpenAI API Key: If it uses openai, create a .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
And use python-dotenv or manually load it in settings_manager.py.

Let me know if you get any errors and I‚Äôll walk you through fixing them.
